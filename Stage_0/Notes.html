        <h3>World Wide Web (Internet in 1990s)</h3>

        <h4>Parts:</h4>
        <p>User, Browser, Internet or cloud and servers. A good video on this:</p>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzyfIiVZPJA">Link to WWW Pieces</a>
        <p>When the user sees a page through the browser, this one makes requests (<b>HTTP</b>) to a server via the Internet. The server responds with a file which is displayed in the browser.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Browsers: <span style="color: green">Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer</span></li>
            <li>Servers: powerful computers hosting files</li>
            <li>HTTP Protocol.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>HTML</h3>
        <p><b>HTML HyperText Markup Language</b> (brings everything together: <em>text, images, videos, music, html</em>) is the main type of document on the Internet.</p>
        <p>Hyper links or links, link to other pages.</p>
        <p>The markup makes the text look different and it's made of tags.</p>

        &lt;NAME&gt; content &lt;/NAME&gt; -> this is called an <b>element</b>

        <h3>Tags</h3>
        Bold <b>b</b><br />
        Italic <b>em</b><br />
        
        <p>It is said, in the world of programming, that computers are stupid because of the way they follow the human instructions.</p>

        <p>For instance, if a closing tag is missing, the computer will render everything after the opening tag the same way.</p>

        <h3>Attributes</h3>
        
        <p>An attribute belongs to the opening tag and has a name and a value.</p>
        
        Anchor <b>a</b>, has an attribute called <em>href</em> and its value can be a URL. When rendered only the content of the tag would be displayed and this is called a <b>link</b><br />
        Image <b>img</b>, has an attribute called <em>src</em> with URL as value. Another attribute is <em>alt</em>, which displays and alternative text if the image is not found. This tag is special, it's a VOID tag, as it has not content.<br />
        
        <p>"This text&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in HTML" renders to "This text in HTML" in the browser. All white spaces turn into a single white space.</p>

        <p><b>br</b> tag is another void tag that breaks a line, while <b>p</b> or paragraph has content, after which the line breaks as well.</p>
  
        <h3>Inline vs Block</h3>
        
        <p>This is a very insightful video on this topic: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOh9WjucNsA">Inline vs Block</a></p>
        
        <div>
            DIV is a block tag <span> and SPAN is inline tag.</span>
        </div>
        
        <p>Example</p>
